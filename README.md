Ising model simulations with the metropolis algorithm
=====================

Simple ising model simulations of a 5x5 lattice by using the metropolis algorithm.
Based on an assignment made for computational physics at Leiden University given by G.T.Barkema.
The original code for that assignment is not uploaded but I am slowly converting the code to a more object oriented program in this repository.

See for an explanation and plots Report-VincentPost.pdf
If you want to know more about ising model simulations or more generally Monte Carlo methods in statistical physics I recommend the book:
"Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics" by M.E.J. Newman and G.T. Barkema
